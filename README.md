# Reply Better AI

Write better anywhere on the web, free and private, with the AI engine of *your* choice. Reply Better AI improves your drafts and helps you reply in context. It runs **free on-device** (Gemini Nano: no key, nothing leaves your computer) where your browser supports it, and falls back to a **free Groq key** or **500+ models on OpenRouter** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, and more) with a searchable picker, free/paid filtering, and live pricing right inside the extension.

![Reply Mode — draft a reply to the conversation you selected](docs/screenshots/reply-mode.png)

## What it does

One small button rides along on any composer and **morphs to fit what you're doing**:

- **Reply mode** (speech bubble) — select the messages you're replying to, click, and pick how to respond: **Match thread · Professional · Friendly · Concise · Summarize**, or **You tell me** to type what to say in *any* language (the reply comes back in that language).
- **Improve mode** (pencil) — once you've typed a draft, the same button polishes it, with a word-level **Changes** diff so you can see exactly what was edited.

Everything streams live, you can **Regenerate** for another take, and **Insert** drops the result into the field with one-tap **Undo**.

| Improve + Changes diff | Streaming popup | Model picker |

## Features

- **Free, zero-setup engine** — on-device AI (Gemini Nano) runs locally with no key and no data leaving your computer, selected automatically when your browser supports it.
- **Five engines, your choice** — on-device, your own local [Ollama](https://ollama.com)/[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) server, a free [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) key, OpenRouter's 500+ models, or any custom **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint. **Auto** picks the best available and falls back across them if one is unavailable; the active engine is always shown inline and in settings.
- **Context-aware inline button** — morphs between Reply and Improve based on what you've selected or typed; sits in the corner of the focused field.
- **Right-click "Help me write or rewrite"** — invoke the same panel from Chrome's context menu on any editable field, with or without a selection. Works on every writable surface, including rich-text editors and pages that disable native spellcheck.
- **Selection-only rewriting** — select text inside any field, choose "Help me write or rewrite", and only the selected range is replaced on Insert; surrounding text is preserved.
- **Reply to a conversation** — selection-first context capture, tone presets, summarize, or a free-form instruction in any language.
- **Live streaming** — results type in as they're generated, in the popup and the inline panel alike.
- **Changes diff** — word-level additions/deletions between your draft and the rewrite.
- **Regenerate** — cycle fresh variations with a version counter.
- **Dynamic model picker** — Popular / Free / All tabs, search, provider filter, context window, and live per-token pricing.
- **Auto · Fastest free** — one pick that routes to the fastest available free model and fails over automatically when one is busy or errors (reasoning models excluded; shows which model answered).
- **Inline model switch + recovery** — swap models without leaving the page; when a free model is rate-limited, switch and retry in one tap.
- **Works on React, Vue, Angular, Gmail, Notion** — `writeText` uses the prototype's native value setter so framework state mirrors what you see, and `execCommand("insertText")` keeps rich-text undo (`Ctrl+Z`) intact.
- **Writing styles** — Improve, Professional, Friendly, Concise, Persuasive — plus your own custom prompts.
- **Snippets** — TextBlaze-style triggers (`/sig`, `/welcome`) that expand as you type in plain text fields.
- **Dark mode** — popup and options follow your system theme.
- **Cross-browser** — one source builds Chrome MV3 and Firefox MV3.
- **Privacy-first** — on-device mode sends nothing off your computer; cloud engines use only your own key (stored in `storage.local`) and contact only that provider; only the text you select is ever sent; zero telemetry.

## Install

### Chrome

[Reply Better AI on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reply-better-ai/dpdibbijcljdjnafjnmaljphpkfojlkb) — install in one click.

To run an unreleased build instead: `npm install && npm run build`, then load the `dist/chrome/` folder via `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked**.

### Firefox

[Reply Better AI on AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reply-better-ai/) — install in one click.

### Choose an engine

Open the extension's settings and pick an engine, or leave it on **Auto**:

- **On-device** — free and private, no key. Runs in Chrome (desktop) where Gemini Nano is available; the first use downloads the model once, then nothing leaves your computer.
- **Local (Ollama / LM Studio)** — free and private, no key, and works in any browser. Point the extension at your own [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) server (or any OpenAI-compatible local server) and pick from the models you've installed. See [docs/local-llm-setup.md](./docs/local-llm-setup.md) for setup, including the CORS step.
- **Groq** — free and fast. Create a free key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and paste it in.
- **OpenRouter** — 500+ models, free and paid. Create a key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys); free models are flagged in the picker, paid models bill per-token to your account.
- **OpenAI-compatible (custom)** — any server exposing `/chat/completions`. Bring your own base URL, model name, and optional API key. Useful for hosted providers not on OpenRouter, internal gateways, or local servers with auth.

**Auto** uses on-device when your browser supports it, otherwise your Groq key, otherwise OpenRouter. **Local** and **OpenAI-compatible** are opt-in — select them explicitly to use your own server.

## Usage

**Popup** — click the toolbar icon, paste or type your text, choose a style, then **Improve message**. Watch it stream, flip between **Result** and **Changes**, **Regenerate** for alternatives, and **Copy**.

**Inline — Improve** — start typing in any composer and a pencil button appears in the corner. Click it to open the panel (pick a style, see the diff, Insert), or switch the button to **instant rewrite** in settings for a one-click polish with Undo.

**Inline — Reply** — select the messages you're replying to anywhere on the page; the button turns into a speech bubble. Click it, then pick a tone, **Summarize**, or **You tell me** to type your intent in any language. Insert the drafted reply with one-tap Undo.

**Right-click — Improve or rewrite** — select any text in any editable field (Google search box, Gmail, Notion, a comment box), right-click, and pick **Help me write or rewrite**. The panel opens with the selection as the draft, and on Insert only the selected range is replaced — surrounding text is preserved. Works on plain inputs and rich-text editors alike.

**Model switch** — the active model shows in the panel/popup header; click it to search and swap. Handy when a free model is busy: switch and it retries on the new one. Pick **Auto · Fastest free** to let OpenRouter route to the fastest available free model and fail over automatically — the best default if you're sticking to free models.

**Snippets** — in **Settings**, define triggers like `/welcome` that expand into longer text when typed.

`build.mjs` bundles each entry with esbuild and emits per-browser
manifests (`manifest.chrome.json`, `manifest.firefox.json`) into
`dist/<browser>/`. The inline button and context menu never see your
API key — generation streams through a service-worker port, so the key
stays in the worker.

## Privacy

Reply Better AI runs no servers and ships zero telemetry. Your API keys, prompts, and snippets stay in your browser. With the on-device or local (Ollama/LM Studio) engines, nothing ever leaves your computer. With a cloud engine, only the text you select (or explicitly capture) is sent, and the only network traffic is to the provider you chose (Groq or OpenRouter) when you ask for an improvement or a reply. See [docs/privacy.md](./docs/privacy.md) for the full policy.
